# We can also add it to our path forever by editing our .bashrc

## vim ~/.bashrc  # To open the file in vim
## :$  # This navigates to the bottom of the vim file

## Hit return to add a new line
## Type out: export PATH=$PATH:~/cgp_experiment/julia/bin
## esc
## :wq # This saves and exits the file
## source ~/.bashrc # This activates our new bash file

# This is a test experiment
# This will run 10 individuals for 100 frames each (max)
# After running this, you'll see a graph in the graphs folder for the centipede
# game
julia experiments/atari.jl --render --frames 100 --total_evals 10

# If you want to view the graph, you can pull it down to your machine using sftp

# When you're ready to run the actual experiments, you can run the following
# command, just substituting the --id flag with the proper game name as listed in
# this repo: https://github.com/openai/atari-py/tree/master/atari_py/atari_roms
# Just be sure to not include the `.bin`

julia experiments/atari.jl --render --id GAME_NAME --frames 6000 --total_evals 5000

# So for example, if I wanted to play the james bond game, I would run:
# julia experiments/atari.jl --render --id jamesbond --frames 6000 --total_evals 5000
